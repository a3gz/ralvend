Welcome to **RalVend** the free open source Vending System for Second Life. 

## Motivation

  * As a builder in Second Life, I want freedom to create unique experiences for my customers instead of accepting what's imposed by closed-code systems.

  * I think that creators with more skills than cashflow should be able to offer high quality service while keeping control over their tools and their data.

  * For most merchants, selling in Second Life doesn't make economic sense. I belive that a free vending system will help to aliviate the burden of keeping an in-world store; bringing back the fun of it.

  * Open Source software makes things happen. I like Second Life and I would like to see it recover previous glories. I hope that free tools that lower the barriers to entry will incentivate less commerce-oriented creators to set up shop in this beautiful thing that is Second Life.

## Fair warning

I started this project recently and I'm still trying to figure out how to solve some critical challenges such as **authentication**. My goal is to come up with a solution that combines a high level of security while still making it easy for merchants to set up the system.

I will update this document when I think the system is ready for other merchant (besides myself) to use it. Stay tuned and feel free to send me your ideas. 

Another thing that's important to mention here is that my situation may change and development may start to move slower.

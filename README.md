Welcome to **RalVend** the free open source Vending System for Second Life. 

## Motivation

  * As a builder in Second Life, I want freedom to create unique experiences for my customers instead of accepting what's imposed by closed-code systems.

  * I think that creators with more skills than cashflow should be able to offer high quality service while keeping control over their tools and their data.

  * For most merchants, selling in Second Life doesn't make economic sense. I belive that a free vending system will help to aliviate the burden of keeping an in-world store; bringing back the fun of it.

  * Open Source software makes things happen. I like Second Life and I would like to see it recover previous glories. I hope that free tools that lower the barriers to entry will incentivate less commerce-oriented creators to set up shop in this beautiful thing that is Second Life.

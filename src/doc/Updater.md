# Updater

Updater objects are used to update other objects: Warehouse, Vendor, etc.

An Updater is meant to update anything: configuration, scripts, resources, etc.
The Update process follows a protocol known by all the involved parties in which the updater ends up giving new versions of whatever thing is being updated to all the intended recipients.
